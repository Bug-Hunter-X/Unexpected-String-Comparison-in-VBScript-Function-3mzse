This example demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript stemming from its dynamic typing system.  When comparing values, VBScript will perform string comparisons if the values are enclosed in quotes, even if they appear to be numbers.  This can lead to unexpected results. The solution shows how to explicitly convert string arguments to numbers for correct numerical comparisons.
